                <img src="img/gyres.jpg" width="100%">
                <p>The Great Pacific Garbage Patch was discovered in 1997 by Charles Moore when he was sailing to his home in
                    Los Angeles and noticed lots of debris. For a long time nobody really did anything about the patch so it
                    started to accumulate.</p>
                <p>One of the big contributors to ocean plastic is river plastic run off. So then there is a large amount of
                    trash in the oceans. This trash gets sucked into gyres, which is like a spiral/vortex in the ocean. But
                    in the middle of the gyres it is peaceful so the trash eventually ends up there, creating the patches of
                    garbage in the ocean.</p>

            <section data-scene="statistics">
                <h2>Statistics</h2>
                <img src="img/stats.jpg" width="100%">
                <p>"It is estimated that 1.15 to 2.41 million tonnes of plastic are entering the ocean each year from rivers."
                    The estimated size of the area is 1.6 million square kilometers which is two times the size of Texas or
                    three times the size of France.

                <img src="img/patches.jpg" width="100%">
                <p><center></p>
                <p>While the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the most well there are four other accumulation zones that
                  have started to form. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is looked in the pacific halfway between Hawaii and
                  California. The second zone is located between South Africa and Australia. The third in the South Pacific
                  South America. The fourth in the South Atlantic on the other side of Sotuh America. The fifth and final
                  zone is in the North Atlantic between North America and Europe.

            <section data-scene="care">
                <h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
                <img src="img/bio.jpg" width="100%">
                <p>Besides the obvious reason to care about the environment that you are living in you should also care because
                    of the bioaccumulation that occurs in the food chain. Bioaccumulation is when one something small like shrimp
                    eats the plastics in the ocean. Then a slightly bigger acquatic animal eats many of them and so on. This
                    happens all the way up the food chain to us, so eating fish or other acquatic animals equats to eating a decent
                    bit of plastic. This is obviously bad because plastic is a made up of chemcicals and can be toxic to eat.</p>

                    on the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The founder is Boyan Slat, a then teenager from the Netherlands.</p>

                        that happens to our oceans.The story map library is derived from the
                        storymap plugin for leaflet at <a>http://atlefren.github.io/storymap/</a>, and its functionality
                        relies on both leaflet and Boostrap.</p>
