                  have started to form. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is looked in the pacific halfway between Hawaii and

                  South America. The fourth in the South Atlantic on the other side of Sotuh America. The fifth and final
                  zone is in the North Atlantic between North America and Europe.</p>

                <p>"It is estimated that 1.15 to 2.41 million tonnes of plastic are entering the ocean each year from rivers."
                    The estimated size of the area is 1.6 million square kilometers which is two times the size of Texas or

                <h2>Salem</h2>
                <p>Salem is the capital of the U.S. state of Oregon, and the county seat of Marion County. It is located
                    in the center of the Willamette Valley alongside the Willamette River, which runs north through the

                    in 1851, and was incorporated in 1857.</p>
                <p>Salem had a population of 154,637 at the 2010 census, making it the third largest city in the state
                    after Portland and Eugene. Salem is less than an hour driving distance away from Portland. Salem is

            <section data-scene="bend">
                <h2>Bend</h2>
                <p>Bend is a city in, and the county seat of Deschutes County, Oregon, United States. It is the
                    principal city of the Bend, Oregon Metropolitan Statistical Area. Bend is Central Oregon's largest
                    city, and despite its modest size, is the de facto metropolis of the region, owing to the low
                    population density of that area. Bend recorded a population of 76,693 at the time of the 2010 U.S.
                    Census, up from 52,029 at the 2000 census. The estimated population of the city as of 2013 is
                    81,236. Bend's metro population was estimated at 165,954 as of July 1, 2013. The Bend MSA is the
                    fifth largest metropolitan area in Oregon.</p>
                <p>Bend is located on the eastern edge of the Cascade Range along the Deschutes River. Here the
                    Ponderosa Pine forest transitions into the high desert, characterized by arid land, junipers,
                    sagebrush, and bitter-brush. Originally a crossing point on the river, settlement began in the early
                    1900s. Bend was incorporated as a city in 1905. Economically, it started as a logging town but is
                    now identified as a gateway for many outdoor sports, including mountain biking, fishing, hiking,
                    camping, rock climbing, white-water rafting, skiing, paragliding and golf. In 2015, Men's Journal
                    ranked Bend as one of The 10 Best Places to Live Now.</p>

                <p>In order to make a difference when it comes to something like this we all have to change what we do.
                  There are groups like the Ocean Cleanup that have taken action to remove the plastics from the ocean
                  but we as indivudals need to make a conscious choice to stop using single use plastics.</p>
