                <img src="img/ghibli.jpg" width="100%">
                <i>Some of the studio's most iconic characters.</i>
                <p><center>Known for their whimsical stories and dreamworthy animation, Studio Ghibli is the most famous animation company in the world. Many
                   visitors hope to see their favorite stories in the flesh. Trinkets and other merchandise are often sought after by tourists and fans alike.</p>
                <p>Japan takes great pride in their animation (and Ghibli in particular) and so there are a variety of places to visit. People may come to Japan
                   to view the scenery which may have inspired the films, visiting themed establishments such as the Ghibli Museum, or Shirohige's Cream Puff Factory.</p>

                <i>Moomin Cafe, Tokyo.</i>
                <p><center>Japan is notorious for its themed cafes, and among those cafes are the ever-popular animal cafes.
                   Japan was the originator of animal cafes, most known for their cat cafes and dog cafes, in which
                   visitors can play with and pet various animals while enjoying a nice drink or a snack. In recent years,
                   there has been an upsurge in the more unusual cafes, including animals such as hedgehogs, raccoons, and penguins. Other popular cafes
                   may be centered around anime and manga, fairytales, or occupations.</p>

                <i>Photo of Hachi (1934).</i>
                <p><center>Hachi is a household name in Japan but does not belong to a great emperor or famous celebrity, but rather the dog which was the
                   epitome of loyalty. The dog was bonded so strongly to its owner Hidesaburo Ueno, accompanying him to Shibuya Station for his morning commute, and
                   returning at the end of the day to walk home together. One morning, Professor Ueno suffered a brain hemorrhage while at work, and tragically passed.
                   Without knowing what had happened, Hachi returned to the Station day after day to wait for his owner.</p>

                <p><center></p>
                <p>Japan is well-known for its beautiful scenery and classic temples, with many spanning all across the country. Here, we focus on Kyoto. Kyoto had previously been the capital city of Japan,
                   but is now the top of the pyramid when its comes to its nature and scenery. It is known particularly for its classic Buddhist temples, gardens, imperial palaces, Shinto shrines, and traditional
                   wooden houses. Many of its top attractions boast breathtaking scenery that is perfect for those who enjoy quiet, scenic walks, and calming aesthetics.</p>

                <i>Deer relaxing under the cherry blossoms at Nara Park.</i>
                <p><center>Animals are considered to be symbols of good luck and good fortune, stemming from the beliefs of Japan's traditional religion: Shinto. Significant animals are featured in shrines and altars,
                   as well as pieces of art and folklore. To this day, animals are thought of as sacred, almost of a higher importance than humans. There are many sites around Japan which feature animals, who live
                   alongside humans in harmony. Japan's deep connection to nature can be seen across the nation.</p>

                    <p>This is a web map of tourist sites in Japan, organized by category. The main objective
                      is to promote tourism for the country, especially locations which are not as
                      publicized, or in the very least enlighten viewers on some of the interesting
                      things that Japan has to offer. This map was made as a project for GEOG 458:
                      Advanced Digital Geographies at the University of Washington, Seattle (June 2020).
                        The story map library is derived from the
                        storymap plugin for leaflet at <a>http://atlefren.github.io/storymap/</a>, and its functionality
                        relies on both leaflet and Boostrap.</p>
